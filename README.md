MangaCMS
========

Comic/Manga Download tool and reader.

Plugin scrapers for MangaTraders (defunct), Doujin-Moe, and Fufufuu.net, as well as metadata extraction from MangaUpdates.

Streaming archive decompression so there are no temprary files or unzipped archives for the reader.

Has lots of dependencies:

 - Mako
 - CherryPy
 - Pyramid
 - Beautifulsoup
 - Selenium (to interface with GhostJS)
 - GhostJS
 - FeedParser (possibly defunct since MT is down).
